PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established in 2015, provide a global framework to address key challenges related to health, infrastructure, justice, sustainability, and inclusive development. Among them, SDG-6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG-16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and SDG-17 (Partnerships for the Goals) focus on urgent, interconnected priorities such as water access, accountable governance, and global cooperation. To track progress, the UN maintains a large and complex dataset, which surpassed 2.7 million records in 2023. Available in formats like CSV and JSON, this data spans hundreds of indicators and involves numerous global actors. However, its scale and multidimensional nature make it difficult to interpret using traditional 2D visualizations. These tools often fall short in representing the dynamic relationships between countries, goals, and funding flows, limiting the ability of stakeholders to act on insights or coordinate efforts effectively. There is a need for a more effective visualization approach that can reveal the underlying structure of global development activities. Such tools should enable stakeholders to explore donor-recipient roles, track financial and policy connections over time and location, and better understand how various elements of SDG progress are interlinked. This project addresses that need by creating immersive, interactive 3D visualizations that make complex data more accessible and actionable.

PROJECT GOALS

This project aims to enhance the understanding and visualization of global development efforts by mapping partnerships and indicator-level progress across selected Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By transforming complex and multidimensional datasets into an accessible, interactive format, the project supports both strategic policymaking and local-level engagement.

For Spring 2025, we specifically focussed on SDG-6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG-16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and SDG-17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The project centers on the following critical indicators:
SDG-6: 6.3.1 (Wastewater treatment), 6.3.2 (Ambient water quality), 6.5.1 (Integrated water resources management), 6.a.1 (ODA to water and sanitation)
SDG-16: 16.1.1 (Intentional homicides), 16.3.2 (Unsentenced detainees), 16.5.1 (Bribery incidence), 16.6.1 (Government expenditure as a proportion of the approved budget)
SDG-17: 17.3.1 (Foreign direct investments, remittances, and official development assistance)                
Using the GaiaViz app, we explored the structure and flow of development partnerships, the roles of donors, beneficiaries, and torchbearers, as well as the geographic and temporal dimensions of funding and policy.
Additionally, we incorporated open-access datasets from the UN SDG website to enrich the visualization with donor-recipient funding relationships, adding valuable context to the financial and implementation dynamics of SDGs.
The conclusion of this project will be a comprehensive 3D interactive visualization that reveals the intricate interconnections among countries, Sustainable Development Goals, and financial flows. It will showcase how individual initiatives and stakeholders, such as torchbearers, beneficiaries, and implementing partners, contribute to collective progress on global development targets. By presenting these relationships in a transparent and engaging manner, the visualization will support more effective communication, coordination, and collaboration among international development stakeholders.
